## A Twitter Stream
Running this script allows you to listen live on tweets being made with a specific search term. As tweets come in, a file is created and the tweets are appended onto the file.
To customize the search term, go to `stream.py` and set [`searchterm`](https://github.com/vishwa35/twitstream/blob/master/stream.py#L14) equal to your desired term.
